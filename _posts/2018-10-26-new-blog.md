New blog here. Couple thoughts about setting it up.

This is mostly for me to work thorugh my thoughts. I tend to think about things and have a conversation in my head and it's helpful to write it down. Maybe something interesting will be written at some point, maybe not. In the meantime it works for me to tap tap tap out some words as I think.

Doing this on github pages as a Jekyll site. I like that I can just write markdown and have all my posts committed to a git repo, rather than in a database somewhere. I like that I have all the source content in a format that will last, I'll always have the text in essentially text files. Good stuff.
