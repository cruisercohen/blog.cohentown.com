Playing around with Firebase for a few reasons. It's interesting. It's free to host a small site like my random junk I create for self-learning. It has an intruiging way to work with data, the built in web services that automatically give access to the database hosted on firebase. Really straigtforward way to build a site that has simple data access needs and deploy with no fuss.
