During recent interview process I encountered a number of different organizational structures and found some interesting things I hadn't seen before.

Really liked one structure where there was very distinct technical leadership from management leadership. Each team had a manager who was there to remove blockers, do reviews, promote the team, work with employees on advancing their career. They also had technical leadership, which went up beyond the team level.

I've seen the division before, but not in such a smooth way. Previously the managers didn't have much to do with helping out employees, they managed up only and that wasn't great.
