I recently went through the process of interviewing for a new job. It was pretty eye-opening as I haven't had to **really** interview for a job in about 12 years. The process is much more rigorous now. In the end I actually enjoyed it, I learned a lot, and I felt really confident in the job I ended up at.


## Randomness
There is a lot of randomness when you drop off resumes, sometimes never hear anything. Did it get lost? Did they not like me? Are they busy and haven't looked? Are they moving to a new building and the internet isn't working (true story)? There's no way to know.

Other randomness is who you draw for an interview, how their day is going, who else they've talked to, etc.. Also whether you guessed right with the position you applied for, whether they have some specific issue bugging them right now, and many other factors.

## Types of questions
I don't love language gotcha questions. There's a lot of stuff you learn to avoid when you have a lot of experience in a language. Stuff that is just weird, or makes for code that is hard to understand or debug, or just doesn't work very well. Some interviews go deep into the whys of these things and expect full knowlege of all the pitfalls. Sometimes you just know there are a lot of pitfalls that you learned years ago. I don't go back to review all the whys of the pitfalls, they just are to be avoided, and code that goes deep into them is basically bad code, why beat it to death and test on all the different angles of why it's bad.

I do love solving problems, puzzles, algorithms, etc.. It's fun to try to figure something out and demonstarte skill that way. 

System design and architecture questions are great too. 

## Other
Things are very organized at proper organizations. I liked how different things were assigned to different people/groups to find out. I didn't love where all the interviews were individual, couldn't get a sense of how people worked together as a team. I really liked the campfire interview I did where we all did a campfiring coding session together for an hour of the interview, then talked aobut it. I got a really good sense of what the team was like and what life on the team would look like.
